/* 
    > Practice 4! In this one we already have a lot of HTML, so let's style it

*/

/*
    First let's "clear" the default margin and padding from everything
    (HINT: * selector)
*/

/*
    > Now, let's style the "hero" class with the following properties
        ☑️ set a height of 30vh, width of 100%
        ☑️ set the background-image property so it uses the image from this URL:
"https://assets.codepen.io/6060109/window.jpg" 
as the background

        ☑️ Set background-size so the width fits 100%, and background-position as center
    .*/

    /* 
        ☑️ style the H4 text, use the POSITION: absolute, top, and left properties to position the text "How to use flex box" so it fits inside the window! 
    */

    /*
    > Ok let's...
        ☑️ style ALL "section"s with text aligned to center, 50px margin
        ☑️ style ALL "box-ctr"s with display flex, height 15vh, width 100%, background color lightgrey
    */


    /*
    > Third, let's style the "box" class
        ☑️ set a width of 5%, a height of 30%, 1px solid black border on ALL boxes
        ☑️ write 3 advanced selectors, the 1st should select the 1st box inside each box-ctr, the 2nd selects the 2nd... etc
        ☑️ using these, make first box in every container red, second green, third blue
    */


    /*
    > Last, let's style each of the box containers INDIVIDUALLY
        ☑️ We have made it easier for you with "box-ctr-n" classes
        ☑️ box-ctr-1 should look like this
            |                |
            |     [][][]     |
            |                |
        ☑️ box-ctr-2 should look like this
            |                |
            |                |
            |  []   []   []  |
        ☑️ box-ctr-3 should look like this
            |              []|
            |              []|
            |              []|
    HINT: use justify-content and align-items on each box-ctr class
    (use .box-ctr-1, .box-ctr-2...)
